# Hello :earth_asia:, I'm Sieg 👨‍

✅ I’m a JavaScript Developer. 

✅ Nowadays, I'm working on Web3 projects, and projects that make use of AI technologies.

✅ At present, I'm learning how to build AI-powered projects using the LangChain framework.

✅ Most of the time, I'm interested on frontend frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and Svelte, building apps using Rust.

✅ I read a lot of blog posts, tech articles, and always finding interesting topics on X (formerly Twitter) several times a day.
