# Hello :earth_asia:, I'm Sieg 👨‍

✅ I’m a JavaScript Developer. 

✅ Nowadays, I'm working on Web3 projects, specifically, Dapp or DeFi web applications.

✅ Most of the time, I'm interested on frontend frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and Svelte, building apps using Rust.

✅ Sometimes, I also touch on Python, Data visualization, Machine learning, AI -- and I read a lot of tech blog posts, tech articles, and news several times a day.
